For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Results

> We carried out a 2 (orientation: toward, away from) × 4
(station: Spadina, St. George, Bloor-Yonge, Sherbourne)
analysis of variance (ANOVA) on closeness ratings, which
revealed no main effect of orientation, F < 1, and a main
effect of station, F(3, 194) = 24.10, p < .001, ηp
2 = .27. This main effect was qualified by the predicted interaction
between orientation and station, F(3, 194) = 16.28, p < .001, ηp2 = .20. We decomposed this interaction by the subjective-distance ratings between participants traveling
east and west for each of the four subway stations.
Westbound participants rated the stations to the west of
Bay Street as closer than did eastbound participants; this
effect was obtained for both the station one stop to the
west (St. George, p < .001, ηp2 = .28) and the station two
stops to the west (Spadina, p = .001, ηp2 = .20). The opposite
pattern held true for stations to the east of Bay Street.
Eastbound participants rated the stations to the east of
Bay Street as closer than did westbound participants; this
effect was obtained for both the station one stop to the
east (Bloor-Yonge, p = .053, ηp2 = .08) and the station two
stops to the east (Sherbourne, p < .001, ηp2 = .24). Figure 1 summarizes these results. comparing
